subtitle: Software Engineer, Flutter Developer & Tech Enthusiast
---

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Henry, a software engineer based in the beautiful town of Akosombo, Ghana. When I'm not crafting mobile apps or diving deep into Flutter code, you'll probably find me thinking up new ways to inject Artificial Intelligence into my projects.

### My Journey

My love affair with coding started during my Computer Science days at All Nations University College. But what really got me hooked was discovering Flutter and realizing I could build apps that easily.

### What I Do

Currently, I'm wearing multiple hats (and loving it!). By day, I'm a Software Engineer at Phundit, where I work on innovative solutions that make a real difference in how we manage our finances. By night, I'm the CTO of Sibyl Systems, a startup I founded to pursue my dream of creating educational tech that matters.

### Recent Adventures

One of my proudest achievements is Learn Akan, a language learning app that's helping people connect with Ghanaian culture. With over 5,000 downloads and counting, it's amazing to see how much people like it (if only I had the time to update it).

### My Tech Stack

While Flutter and Dart are my main tools of trade, I'm all about using the right technology for the job. I work extensively with:
- Flutter & Dart (my trusty companions)
- Firebase (for simple and scalable backend solutions)
- BLoC (for simple, powerful and testable state management)
- CI/CD (because automation is awesome)

### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I'm probably:
- Writing tech articles on my [blog](https://henryadu.hashnode.dev/)
- Contributing to open-source projects like [LangChain.dart](https://github.com/davidmigloz/langchain_dart)
- Reviewing Pull Request by Phundit developers
- Exploring new technologies and frameworks

### Let's Connect!
I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, tech enthusiasts, or anyone interested in making cool stuff. Feel free to reach out to me at [aduhenry9@gmail.com](mailto:aduhenry9@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-adu-17b453200).
